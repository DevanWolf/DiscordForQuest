Discord Client Android app modded and optimized for Meta Quest and Android TV devices and the fixed APK is not recommended for phones and tablets, using 126.21 which is the last version to work and display properly (165.15 is however the last version with less UI scaling issues). Note that versions 166 and newer have a bug which has oversized/cut-off UI elements and versions 18x.x instantly crash the app in which all those later versions are not suitable for Quest.

NOTE: classes*.dex are not modified. (If they are, then it's a modded client which is against Discord's TOS)

It is also very useful for watching video on voice channels while you're using Meta Quest Browser alongside it.
#### Known issues:
* Camera features disabled, permission for it removed as such (since the Quest does have cameras for tracking and passthrough, apps like this don't have access to those)
* In-App purchase for Nitro disabled (due to requiring Google Play Services for that), you may need to use the website for using your Discord payment method instead
* Notifications in background are not working due to C2D service being unavailable for Quest
* Sharing your screen crashes the app because it expects to capture your phone's entire screen which doesn't work on Quest, so PLEASE DO NOT PRESS THE SHARE SCREEN BUTTON WHILE ON A VOICE CHANNEL
* 8MB file size upload limit instead instead of 25MB
* Limited support of appilcation commands
* No Soundboard
* Usernames display a #0000 at the end (since Pomolo usernames didn't exist back in 2021)
