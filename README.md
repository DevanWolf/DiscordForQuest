Discord Client Android app modded and optimized for Meta Quest devices and this mod is not designed for phones and tablets, using v165.15 which is the last version to display correctly. Note that versions 166 and newer have a bug which has oversized menu elements and some even-newer ones instantly crash the app in which those versions are not suitable for Quest.

It is also very useful for watching video on voice channels due to being not working on Meta Quest Browser.
#### Known issues:
* Camera features disabled, permission for it removed as such (since the Quest does have cameras for tracking and passthrough, apps like this don't have access to those)
* In-App purchase for Nitro disabled (due to requiring Google Play Services for that), you may need to use the website for using your Discord payment method instead
* Notifications in background are not working due to C2D service being unavailable for Quest
* Voice channel screen sometimes appears as 63:48 to left instead of being to the actual window's aspect ratio and its buttons are not correctly displayed as circle
* Sharing your screen crashes the app because it expects to capture your phone's entire screen which doesn't work on Quest, so PLEASE DO NOT PRESS THE SHARE SCREEN BUTTON WHILE ON A VOICE CHANNEL
* 8MB file size upload limit instead instead of 25MB
* Soundboard unavailable
* Pomolo usernames display a #0 at the end
